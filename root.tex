\begin{abstract}
Intraosseous trancutaneous amputation prostheses (ITAPs) can be used to provide vibrotactile feedback. Vibration transmission through ITAP was investigated computationally. At and below clinically relevant frequencies transmission is linear, above 400 Hz vibration deviates from linear, with a first mode of vibration at 930 Hz. %Abstract here
\newline

\indent \textit{Clinical relevance}— Vibrotactile feedback can enable amputees to ``feel'' using a prosthesis. Combined with ITAP bone-anchors this will provide enhanced osseoperception. %This is a brief additional statement on why a this might be of interest to practicing clinicians.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
Intraosseous trancutaneous amputation prostheses (ITAPs) are bone-anchored, skin-crossing devices which overcome challenges with socket prostheses \cite{c1}. ITAPs present users with sensory feedback through osseoperception, forces on the end prothesis are transmitted directly to the user, and can provide bionic gateways for prosthesis control \cite{c2}.  Vibrotactile feedback enhance osseoperception and provide upper limb prosthesis users with touch and grip-force sensory feedback to close-the-loop, creating intuitive prostheses \cite{c3}. In this paper we characterise vibrations propagating through ITAP estimated using a computational model.

\section{METHODS}

\subsection{The ITAP Model}
A model ITAP was designed with intermedullary stem length of 120 mm, proximal stem radius 6 mm, tapering to 4.5 mm distally.
A 6 mm high 14 mm radius collar sits on the distal bone cortex.
An external spigot has a height of 45 mm and radius of 9 mm.

\subsection{The Computational Approach}
A finite element analysis model was created in Abaqus (v.2021, Linux) using a hexahedral-dominated, 2.5~mm mesh (element types C3D8R and C3D6) with properties that of Titanium 6--4, i.e., elastic material of density 4430~Kg/m$^3$, Young's modulus 114~GPa and Poisson's ratio 0.33.

Both modal analysis and prescribed linear displacement were carried out using Abaqus/Standard.

The model applied a concentrated point-force on the spigot prescribing a linear displacement according to equation (1), where $\textbf{s}$ is displacement in mm, $t$ is time, $f$ is linear frequency, $x$ is a Cartesian axis.
Frequencies between 1 and 900 Hz were investigated, of which up to to 250 Hz are of clinical interest.

\begin{equation}
    \textbf{s}_x(t) = \cos(2\pi f t)
\end{equation}


\section{RESULTS}

\subsection{Modal Analysis}
Natural frequencies of vibration were observed at 930 Hz and 3930 Hz, confirming the device is well-behaved in the clinically relevant frequency range.
\subsection{Low Frequency Analysis}

Observed linear response up to about 400 Hz with a decline in the maximum amplitude of 60 dB/decade.


%\subsection{Figures and Tables}
%
%Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation `Fig. 1', even at the beginning of a sentence.

%Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity `Magnetization', or `Magnetization, M', not just `M'. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write `Magnetization (A/m)' or `Magnetization {A[m(1)]}', not just `A/m'. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write `Temperature (K)', not `Temperature/K.'

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A simple model of an ITAP was created, from which we established an understanding of the device's frequency response.
This study forms the basis for further computational models of vibrations propagating through ITAP. %write in situ instead?

In parallel to more complex models, there is a need for better understanding of the resolution of osseoperception to vibrotactile feedback.
